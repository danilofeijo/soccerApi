# What is soccerApi?
It's a project created to develop simple endpoints with [Express](1) and apply test automation with [Mocha](2) and [Chai](3). They are packages from [NodeJs](4) plataform.

# What we have right now?

## Api development side
- GET request for Teams endpoint ("/teams")

## Test Automation side
N/A

# Environment Set Up
Setting up the environmet is quick and simple. Simply follow the instructions below

## Pre-requeriment
Just ensure that [NodeJs](4) is properly installed. A nice approach to do that is running `node -v` on termianal to check the NodeJs version. If everything is Ok, the Node version should be displayed (e.g. `v8.11.4`)

## Install environment
Open the termianal and...
- Clone the repository - `git clone https://github.com/danilofeijo/soccerApi.git`
- Install packages and their dependencies - `npm install`

## Start the server
Open the termianal and...
- Start the server - `node src/index.js`

So the server must be up and running on: **http://localhost:8081**
